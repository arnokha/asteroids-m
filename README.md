# asteroids-m


Notes:


 - code, variables in: utilities/asteroids_api_utils.py
 - Replace os.environ API key (in utilities/asteroids_api_utils.py) with the key emailed
 - I would've tested the following given more time: simulating request issues, No overlapping results from month_closest_approaches(), element count matches up for the month fn., testing the helper functions, testing for all pages of asteroid_closest_approaches()
